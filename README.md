# CodeandStuff Projects

Welcoe to the CodeandStuff project repository. This repository contains projects we have created for our CodeandStuff attendees for various languages and technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Projects

## Working on your Projects

While working on your repository you should regularly commit your code. This is a good habit to get into and will allow you to go back to a previous version if you make a mistake you can't fix. Generally, code should be committed when you've completed a section. A set of commit messages might look something like this:

* "Wrote the paragraph describing my cat"
* "Added a photo of my cat"
* "Fixed the typos in my cat's description"
* "Updated the title of the page"
* "Changed the background colour to make text more readable"

You can read about some best practices on [this Github page](https://github.com/trein/dev-best-practices/wiki/Git-Commit-Best-Practices).

## Ask for Help!

If you are sturggling with any aspect of the projects don't hesitate to post in the CodeandStuff Slack in the ```#help``` channel. One of the mentors will point you in the right direction and get you back on track. You can also ask for help during the CodeandStuff meetup events.

## When You Finish

When you have finished your project make sure you follow the submission instructions and also post the link in the CodeandStuff ```#project-submissions``` Slack channel.

We will look at your code and commit messages and give you feedback. Please remember the mentors do this in their spare time so please be patient when waiting for your review.

Each project completed will earn you two or more endorsements on your LinkedIn profile.
