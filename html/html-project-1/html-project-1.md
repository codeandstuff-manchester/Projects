# CaS - HTML Project 1 - A Basic Website

Welcome to CodeandStuff HTML Project 1.

In this task you must follow a brief and build a simple website. Follow the instructions given below and host the project in your own GitHub Page repository.

##### Step 1
* For instructions on setting up and working in your GitHub Page repository:
* Complete [CaS Git and GitHub Project 1](https://github.com/codeandstuff-manchester/git-and-github-project/blob/master/project-1.md)
* Create a subfolder in your GitHub page repository with the name "project-1"
* Create an HTML file called "index.html"

##### Step 2 - Main Tasks

You will be building a single page website to show off an interest you have. In your index.html file create:

1. Three sections arranged vertically
    1. Section one is a header section
    2. Section two is the main section
    3. Section three is the footer
2. At least one image in the main section
3. A menu item in the header with a hyperlink
4. At least one ordered or unoredered list
5. OPTIONAL: an embedded video

##### Step 3 - Advanced Tasks

Go through the HTML you've written and make sure it is "semantic".

You can read more about semantic HTML [HERE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics "Semantics - MDN"). For example, your headings should use the ```<h1-6>``` tags.

Semantic HTML makes your website more understandable, not only when you are looking at the code but for things like browsers, search engines, screen readers and accessibility.

### Remember to regularly commit your code! When your project is reviewed we will also be viewing your commits.

##### Step 4 - Submission

1. Share the link to your Github pages in the html-project-1 issues comment section >> [LINK](https://github.com/codeandstuff-manchester/Projects/issues/1)

2. Post the link also in the CodeandStuff ```#project-submissions``` Slack channel.
